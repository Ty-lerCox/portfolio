    "summary": "Angular specialist (Signals, RxJS, NgRx) delivering secure, observable, and automated web applications. Strong in TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and GraphQL—translate UX specs into responsive, pixel‑accurate UIs and optimize Core Web Vitals (LCP/CLS/INP). Eleven years at Expediters International building front‑ends, standing up CI/CD (Ansible, GitHub Actions, GitLab Runners, Azure DevOps), and instrumenting the Grafana stack (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo) for both ops telemetry and product event analytics (click/flow funnels). Integrated SSO with Keycloak/Kerberos, established PKI/TLS, and evolved data ingestion from bespoke Kafka jobs to CDC → Kafka with bronze/silver/gold layers. Prototype quickly in Python; ship production services in Java Spring Boot and C#/.NET. Champion feature flags, DORA metrics, and Kanban to improve delivery flow. Built ODEYA.app, an SSR Angular app that auto‑curates YouTube playlists from channel collections and indexes shareable playlists for SEO.",
