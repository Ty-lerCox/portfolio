_Workboard API_ is a backend service that supports a modular operations platform. It blends secure data access with real-time communication to streamline collaboration across teams.

---

## Introduction

Workboard API provides:

-   **Service Endpoints** – a range of endpoints manage resources, access rules, and operational tasks.
-   **Real-Time Channels** – SignalR hubs push live updates to connected clients.
-   **Web Configuration** – designed to back a responsive web UI and external integrations.

## Key Features

### Secure Access

-   **Role-Based Permissions**

    -   Integrates with an identity provider to verify users and enforce fine-grained policies.
    -   Authorization handlers let teams tailor access levels for different functions.

-   **Auditing & Logging**
    -   NLog traces application behavior for troubleshooting and compliance.

### Data & Process Management

-   **Entity Operations**

    -   Controllers support querying and updating domain data through structured APIs.
    -   Entity Framework bridges the service to SQL databases.

-   **Background Logic**
    -   Repositories encapsulate data operations and application rules.

### Real-Time Coordination

-   **SignalR Hubs**

    -   Push shipment or status data instantly to subscribed clients.

-   **Caching & Metrics**
    -   In-memory caching improves responsiveness.
    -   OpenTelemetry metrics provide insight into API usage and performance.

---

## Technical Backbone

-   **ASP.NET Core**

    -   Provides routing, middleware, and dependency injection for the service.

-   **Keycloak Authentication**

    -   Handles token validation and user claims transformation.

-   **OpenTelemetry & Prometheus**

    -   Exposes custom metrics for monitoring and alerting.

-   **SignalR**
    -   Enables server-to-client messaging for live updates.

## Final Thoughts

Workboard API delivers a flexible foundation for operational tools, combining **secure endpoints**, **real-time communication**, and **observable metrics**. Built with ASP.NET Core and modern libraries, it is ready to scale and adapt as organizational needs evolve.
