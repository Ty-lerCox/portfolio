## Introduction

Workboard API provides:

-   **Service Endpoints** – a range of endpoints manage resources, access rules, and operational tasks.
-   **Real-Time Channels** – SignalR hubs push live updates to connected clients.
-   **Web Configuration** – designed to back a responsive web UI and external integrations.

## Key Features

### Secure Access

-   **Role-Based Permissions**

    -   Integrates with an identity provider to verify users and enforce fine-grained policies.
    -   Authorization handlers let teams tailor access levels for different functions.

-   **Auditing & Logging**
    -   NLog traces application behavior for troubleshooting and compliance.
