## Introduction

Workboard is both:

-   **A Task Hub** – offering list‑driven boards for tracking work items, assignments, and status changes.
-   **A Web Interface** – built in Angular and designed to offload business logic to backend APIs for scalability.
-   **A Lightweight Portal** – enabling users to manage their responsibilities from a standard browser session.
