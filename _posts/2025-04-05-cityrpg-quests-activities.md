CityRPG uses quests and quick activities to keep players busy whether they want story, side hustles, or high‑risk crimes.

## Quest Basics

- **Branching quest lines**: Talk to NPCs or use menus to pick a quest. Dialogue checks your past choices and quest state.
- **Objective tracking**: Each quest has objectives that mark themselves complete when you do the required action or gather items.
- **Repeatable content**: Some quests can restart after completion for steady cash or XP.

## Activities & Side Tasks

- **Task boards**: Short jobs like deliveries, crafting orders, or resource runs appear around the city.
- **Free‑form challenges**: Chop wood, mine stone, or cook meals without taking a job; these still feed related skills.
- **Group events**: Certain activities scale in reward when completed with friends or a business crew.

## Bank Heists & Criminal Missions

- **Laptop required**: Starting a heist consumes a laptop item and raises your wanted level immediately.
- **Hacking puzzle**: A timed typing sequence determines if the vault opens. Wrong answers or leaving early fails the run.
- **Dirty money & crime XP**: Escaping with the loot grants cash and XP while draining the city treasury.

## Quest Log & Tracking

- **In‑game log**: The Angular UI lists available quests, current objectives, and completed entries.
- **Active quest**: Set one quest as active to highlight progress; finished quests move to a completed list.
- **Dialogue hooks**: Talking to NPCs can start quests, advance objectives, or unlock new branches based on past actions.

## Rewards & Progression

- **Currency & items**: Quests pay cash, give items, or unlock recipes and permissions.
- **Skill experience**: Actions tied to a quest also award XP to their related skills—law, crime, crafting, and more.
- **Economy aware**: Some payouts scale with the live economy percentage or city policies.

## Tips

- Stock up before criminal missions; hunger or missing gear can end a run early.
- Bring friends to watch your back during heists or escort deliveries.
- Check the quest log often—new tasks and repeatables appear as the city evolves.
