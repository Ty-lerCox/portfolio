This guide explains how progression works in CityRPG through two pillars: skills and jobs. Use it to pick a role, earn pay, and level up by doing the activities you enjoy.

## Jobs

-   **Where to apply**: Visit the Town Hall or use in‑game job actions to apply/quit. Jobs map to Brickadia teams under the hood, so taking a job also changes your team; quitting drops you back to the neutral team.
-   **Payroll**: Everyone on a job receives an automatic paycheck every few minutes deposited straight into the bank. Payouts can scale with the global economy modifier when active.
-   **Current roles**:
    -   Greeter: Welcome new players and help them get situated.
    -   Courier: Deliver parcels and items around the city.
    -   Shopkeeper: Operate stores and sell goods to other players.
    -   Factory Worker: Craft materials and finished goods.
    -   Police Officer: Enforce the law and respond to crime.
    -   Doctor: Heal and support other players.
    -   Prisoner: Temporary role while serving a sentence (auto‑assigned, auto‑removed on release).

> Note: The Miner and Lumberjack roles have been removed; resource gathering is open to everyone.

### Law Enforcement

-   **Demerits & wanted**: Crimes add demerits and raise a player’s wanted level. Officers can see who is wanted at a glance.
-   **Apprehension rewards**: Eliminating a wanted player grants a small bounty to the officer’s wallet and clears the target’s wanted level. Unlawful kills add demerits even for officers.
-   **Records**: Players can clear their own record inside the Town Hall for a fee using the in‑game action/menu (shortcut command: `/clearrecord`).

### Criminal Play

-   **Not a “job,” but a path**: Crime is a set of activities rather than a formal job—e.g., weapon crafting and sales, bank heists, hacking minigames, and money laundering.
-   **Bounties & risk**: Completing criminal contracts can pay out cash; getting caught adds demerits, raises wanted, and may result in jail time.
-   **Money laundering**: Launder cash in a bank zone. Larger amounts take longer; nearby officers increase the chance of a bust and penalties if caught.

## Skills

CityRPG uses a light, RuneScape‑inspired system: do the activity to gain the related XP. Leveling up unlocks effectiveness, recipes, or opportunities in that area.

-   **Law**: Earn XP for successful apprehensions and lawful actions as an officer.
-   **Crime**: Gain XP by completing criminal activities and bounty‑style contracts.
-   **Crafting**: Make components and goods; improve efficiency and unlock higher tiers over time.
-   **Cooking/Restaurant**: Prepare meals and sell food via shop systems.
-   **Gathering**: Chop wood and mine stone freely; deposit at resource terminals to convert to cash, and use materials in crafting.

> Tip: You don’t need a specific job to level most skills—choose a job for steady income, then pursue the skills you enjoy.

## How Progression Feels

-   **Play → Earn**: Perform actions to gain XP in that skill. Hold a job for steady pay and role‑specific perks.
-   **Economy‑aware**: Paychecks and certain rewards can scale up or down with the live economy value.
-   **Teams & roles**: Your job equals your team; swapping jobs swaps teams automatically.

## Useful Actions & Commands

-   Jobs: Apply/quit at Town Hall UI (or via `/job apply <id>` and `/job quit`).
-   Banking: Payroll goes to your bank account. Bank zone actions include `/deposit`, `/withdraw`, `/balance`.
-   Records: Clear your criminal record inside the Town Hall (`/clearrecord`, fee applies).
-   Purchases: Confirm store/weapon/food buys with `/yes` after a prompt.

## FAQ

-   Can I level skills without a job?  
    Yes. Jobs provide income and a role identity, but most skills level from doing the activity itself.

-   Do I keep progress if I switch jobs?  
    Yes. Skills and inventories persist when you change roles or teams.

-   How do I stop being a prisoner?  
    The prisoner role ends automatically when your sentence expires (even across restarts).
