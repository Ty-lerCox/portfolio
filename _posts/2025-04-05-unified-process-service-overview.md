_UnifiedProcess_ is a backend service that centralizes process configuration and event-driven workflows across the platform. It pairs a GraphQL API with modular components to keep operations scalable, traceable, and ready for future integration.

---

## Introduction

UnifiedProcess is both:

-   **A GraphQL API** – exposes process data through a schema-driven endpoint.
-   **A Modular Codebase** – library modules contain domain logic, while POJO modules define schema types and event payloads.
-   **A Stream Processor** – Kafka-driven components react to change requests and coordinate downstream effects.

---

## Key Features

### Configurable Workflows

-   **Process Definitions**
    -   Store and retrieve workflow configurations with versioning and validation.
    -   Tailor process stages through the GraphQL schema.
-   **Change Requests**
    -   Capture updates, route them to processors, and persist outcomes.

### Event Handling

-   **Kafka Integration**
    -   Dedicated processors listen to topics and apply business rules.
    -   Avro serialization keeps messages consistent across services.
-   **Asynchronous Updates**
    -   Non-blocking execution ensures responsive APIs while background tasks complete.

### Observability

-   **OpenTelemetry Support**
    -   Auto-instrumented traces for API calls and processors.
    -   Metrics ready for aggregation in distributed dashboards.
-   **Structured Logging**
    -   Logback and JSON formatting for centralized log analytics.

### Persistence

-   **Postgres Storage**
    -   Reliable, transactional store for process data.
    -   Tests default to in-memory options for quick feedback loops.

## Technical Backbone

-   **Java & Spring Boot**
    -   Modern Java runtime with Spring Boot for dependency injection and configuration.
-   **GraphQL Server**
    -   GraphQL Java powers schema definitions and resolvers.
-   **Maven Build**
    -   Multi-module setup for API, library, POJO models, and processors.
-   **CI Integrations**
    -   Maven plugins for testing, OWASP checks, and container builds via Jib.

## Final Thoughts

UnifiedProcess streamlines platform workflows by combining **schema-driven APIs**, **event-driven processors**, and **centralized configuration**. Its modular design and observability features keep it adaptable as organizational needs evolve.
