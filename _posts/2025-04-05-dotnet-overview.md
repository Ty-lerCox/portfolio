_.NET Service_ offers a lightweight example of a containerized service built with the modern .NET stack, suitable for experimentation or extension.

---

## Introduction

The sample illustrates:

-   **Minimal Service Logic** – keeps implementation concise for learning or prototyping.
-   **Containerization** – packaged with a Dockerfile for reproducible builds.
-   **Scalable Foundation** – can evolve into a full microservice.

---

## Key Features

### Simplified Codebase

-   **Clear Entry Point**
    -   Easy to understand and modify.
-   **Extensible Layers**
    -   Build out APIs or background tasks as needed.

### Docker Workflow

-   **Build Instructions**
    -   Standard commands for image creation.
-   **Runtime Configuration**
    -   Supports environment variables for flexible setups.

---

## Technical Backbone

-   **C# / .NET Runtime**
    -   Utilizes the latest framework features.
-   **Dockerfile**
    -   Guides multi-stage builds.
-   **Lean Dependencies**
    -   Focuses on essentials to keep images small.

## Final Thoughts

The .NET Service acts as a neutral scaffold for containerized applications, enabling experimentation without exposing proprietary implementations.
