This guide dives into how businesses, shops, and the wider community ecosystem work together in CityRPG. Use it to start a company, sell goods, and understand how city policies and the live economy affect your day‑to‑day play.

## What Counts as a Business

- **Solo or group**: Run a one‑person shop or form a multi‑player company to pool storage, recipes, and profits.
- **Shared systems**: Businesses coordinate crafting, inventory, pricing, and storefronts; members can contribute resources and time based on permissions.
- **Bank vs. wallet**: Day‑to‑day purchases use your wallet; sales and payroll typically route through bank accounts for persistence and safety.
- **Economy‑aware**: Certain payouts (like job payroll) scale with the live economy value; sales and taxes may be influenced by city policy.

> Tip: Even without a formal “Business” UI, you can operate as a team using shared storage, storefronts, and clear roles.

## Starting Or Joining One

- **Find a spot**: Claim a lot and build your storefront or workshop.
- **Recruit**: Invite friends to help gather, craft, cook, or staff the counter.
- **Set roles**: Decide who handles sourcing, crafting, pricing, and customer service.
- **Use in‑game menus**: Where available, use Town Hall/Business desks or in‑game actions to manage membership and permissions.

## Shops, Restaurants, And Sales

- **General store & prompts**: Interact with store/crafting/food bricks to buy and sell. Players confirm purchases with `/yes` after a prompt for safety.
- **Food & hunger**: Restaurants use food‑purchase bricks to sell meals that keep hunger in check. Profits credit the seller and a small cut supports the city.
- **Weapons & signage**: Weapon signs (e.g., `buy_p:Weapon_Shotgun:250:SellerName`) let players sell gear. On confirmation, the buyer pays, the seller receives their cut (e.g., 75%), and a small percent feeds the economy.
- **Offline receipts**: Sellers automatically receive inbox messages confirming sales, so shopkeepers can run stores even while offline.
- **Pricing**: Set fair prices, consider economy swings, and watch stock levels to avoid outages.

## Crafting And Supply Chain

- **Inputs**: Gather wood and stone freely; convert at deposit terminals to generate cash or use raw materials in recipes.
- **Stations**: Use crafting benches to turn inputs into components and finished goods for sale.
- **Tiering**: Higher skill and recipe unlocks improve efficiency and margins over time.
- **Division of labor**: Assign members to gathering, crafting, cooking, sales, and restocking for a steady loop.

## Money Flow, Banking, And Taxes

- **Banking basics**: Job payroll deposits straight into bank accounts. Store sales typically credit the seller and log a small city contribution.
- **Payout examples**: A weapon sale credits most of the price to the seller, with a small percentage routed to the economy or city funds.
- **Business accounting**: Keep a ledger of materials costs, sale prices, and net profit. Use bank deposits/withdrawals to separate business from personal spending.
- **Taxes & policy**: City leadership can adjust tax rates and policies that influence business costs and margins.

## Elections, Policy, And The Live Economy

- **Elections**: When enough players are online, elections may start automatically. Candidates pay to enter; the top vote‑getter becomes leader until removed or replaced.
- **Taxes & budgets**: Leaders can set or influence city taxes and spending priorities that affect businesses and citizens.
- **Live economy**: The city’s economy percentage drifts over time and can be affected by events. Some rewards scale with this value.
- **Donations**: Players can donate to buoy the economy. Use `/donate <amount>` to contribute; a portion of the donation raises the economy within configured caps.

## Community Systems

- **Banking actions**: Inside bank zones use `/deposit`, `/withdraw`, and `/balance` to manage funds.
- **Inbox & messages**: Use `/msg <player> <text>` to send mail and `/inbox [page]` to read it. Sale confirmations arrive here, too.
- **Law & order**: Demerits raise wanted level; officers earn bounties for lawful apprehensions. Clear your record at Town Hall with `/clearrecord` (fee applies).
- **Events & security**: Bank heists require certain conditions (e.g., officers online). Criminal activity impacts the economy and risk/reward for everyone.

## Recommended Loops For Businesses

- **Starter shop**: Buy a lot → Source basic materials → Craft beginner goods → Price modestly → Reinvent stock based on sales.
- **Restaurant**: Farm inputs → Cook meals → Set menu board prices → Stay open during peak hours for steady traffic.
- **Arms dealer**: Craft or source weapons → Use signage for sales → Track margins and restock often.
- **Co‑op**: Split roles among friends → Use inbox to coordinate off‑hours → Reinvest profits into better tools and recipes.

## Useful Commands

- Purchases: Confirm with `/yes` after prompts.
- Banking: `/deposit`, `/withdraw`, `/balance` inside bank zones.
- Economy: `/donate <amount>` to support the city economy.
- Messaging: `/msg <player> <text>`, `/inbox [page]` for offline receipts and mail.

## FAQ

- Can I run a business solo?  
  Yes. Many players start alone, then invite friends as demand grows.

- How do seller payouts work?  
  Purchases confirm with `/yes`; most of the price credits the seller, with a small city cut. Food and weapon signs follow the same two‑step flow.

- Do policy and economy affect me?  
  Yes. Taxes and the live economy percentage can influence earnings, costs, and payouts.

- What if I get a criminal record?  
  Clear it at the Town Hall with `/clearrecord` (fee). Officers gain lawful rewards for apprehensions; unlawful kills add demerits.
