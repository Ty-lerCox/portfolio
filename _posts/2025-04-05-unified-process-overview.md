## Introduction

This platform is:

-   **A Workflow Editor** – enabling authorized users to assemble processes, activities, and variations through a visual UI.
-   **A Service-Oriented Front End** – state and data flow through GraphQL APIs and NGRX-managed stores, making the system reliable and consistent.
-   **An Internal Portal** – providing centralized access to configuration, search, and change tracking across multiple business domains.

## Technical Backbone

-   **Angular UI**

    -   All admin menus and dialogs are built with Angular and Material components for consistency.

-   **GraphQL Services**

    -   Data is requested and persisted through a GraphQL layer, enabling fast, typed queries.

-   **State Management**

    -   NGRX handles client-side state, making complex interactions predictable and testable.

-   **Scalability**
    -   Modular design allows new workflow types or integrations to be added with minimal impact on existing features.
