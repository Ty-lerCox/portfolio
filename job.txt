Overview
Application
Loot Labs is on a mission to make collecting fun. We are passionate about bridging the gap between collectible markets and avid collectors.

Our product, Boxed.gg, offers a marketplace that facilitates the purchase and trade of digital items in an accessible manner. The platform initially focused on physical trading card games such as Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh!, allowing users to digitally unbox rare cards and have the physical items shipped to their doorsteps.

We’re hiring a Senior Backend Engineer to design and scale the systems behind our products. You’ll lead architecture discussions, ship secure and performant APIs, and collaborate closely across the stack. We’re looking for someone who doesn’t just write code, but owns the full system lifecycle from design to debugging to iteration.
